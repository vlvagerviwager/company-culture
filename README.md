That learning is a gift; you can use it to change for the better, no matter where you fit in your company. |
| [Close to 60 Percent of Surveyed Tech Workers Are Burnt Out—Credit Karma Tops the List for Most Employees Suffering From Burnout](https://www.teamblind.com/blog/index.php/2018/05/29/close-to-60-percent-of-surveyed-tech-workers-are-burnt-out-credit-karma-tops-the-list-for-most-employees-suffering-from-burnout/) | The results for Netflix and Credit Karma seem to reflect what users are saying about these companies on Blind. Netflix is mostly described as a desirable place to work with high compensation, balanced hours, and supportive coworkers–conditions that reduce the risk of burnout. The most negative comment you'll likely find is that Netflix has a defined culture that can be "cultish" but you'll rarely find a post that says the company is toxic. |
